          hi, i'm james. this is my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          i teach coding online on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jamesmurdza" target="_blank">youtube channel</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jamesmurdza/streams" target="_blank">livestreams</a>. <a href="https://github.com/jamesmurdza/building-resources/" target="_blank">here's</a> some of the things i've learned recently while building.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          want to <strong>build</strong> something with me? tweet me.
        </p>
        <p>
          want to join a workshop or study session? i'm currently running workshops in:
          <ul>
            <li>machine learning</li>
            <li>low code app development</li>
            <li>full-stack development</li>
            <li>automation with google sheets</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          here's some more information about me: i've been coding for about 20 years. i want to help more people (like you?) to get into software development. this is a skill that i think should be way more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          i have a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering. i was part of founding a student startup called <a href="https://flysilverwing.com/" target="_blank">silverwing</a> and a <a href="https://makerspacedelft.nl/" target="_blank">community-led makerspace</a> in delft.
        </p>
        <p>
          i like to write. here are a few topics i'm interested in:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://possibleplanets.com/2022/05/06/how-to-forecast-the-climate.html" target="_blank">developer tools</a></li>

            <li>looking for some less nerdy interests...</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
